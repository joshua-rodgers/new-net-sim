## Concept
 The basic idea is to have a terminal like interface embedded in a web page in which
 you may enter commands that construct networks, generating PCs, switches, and routers 
 that you may configure and interact with. A simple table will be dynamically generated on 
 the page to help you visually keep track of what you've built so far.
